This is my interpretation of the "Life in the Wild" project from the Complete Web Developer course from Zero To Mastery. 

I wanted to do a little skill refreshing since I haven't coded in like 3 years. I added an excellent dark background to really help the images pop.  I used the CSS filter property to add a sepia filter to the pictures, and upon hover, the filter is removed to show the original color, and the photo is slightly enlarged.

It's a simple, yet beautiful project and I enjoyed making it!
